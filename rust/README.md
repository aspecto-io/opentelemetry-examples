# Example of using Opentelemetry in Rust

[Blog](https://www.aspecto.io/blog/distributed-tracing-with-opentelemetry-rust/)

In this example we show how to add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry to a Rust application. We demonstrate how to add both manual instrumentation and library-provided instrumentations.

We are using [`opentelemetry-otlp`] to export the traces to Aspecto platform.
